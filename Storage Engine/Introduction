Storage Engine
---------------------------
1. Database Architecture
    -> Transport - Cluster Communication (Communication between nodes), Client Communication (Requests coming from apps)
    -> Query Processor 
        - Query Parser  -> Parse the query, validate it
        - Query Optimizer
            - Finds most efficient Query execution plan
    -> Execution Engine
        - Executes the query execution plan
        - Collects results of Local execution (run on storage engine) and Remote Execution (run on different nodes in cluster)
    -> Storage Engine
        - Transaction Manager
        - Lock Manager
        - Access Methods
        - Buffer Manager
        - Recovery Manager

2. Type of database as per storage  
    - Memory -> In this type data stored in memmory and for backup & recovery disk is utilized
    - Disk Based -> In this type data stored in disk and memory used for caching.

3. Types of Database as per how data stored in disk 
    - Column wise - Ex- Apache Parquet
        - Useful for analytical workloads that comput aggregations
    - Row wise - Ex- PostgreSQL, MySQL
    - Wide column 
        - It should not mixed up with column wise. 
        - HBase, BigTable where data is represented as a multidimensional map, columns are grouped into column families and inside each column family data is stored row-wise

4. Database stored data in files but instead of relying on filesystem hierarchies of directories and files for locating records, they compose files using implementation-specific formats. The main reason to use specialized file organization over flat files are:
    - Storage efficiency
    - Access efficiency
    - Update efficiency

5. Types of storage files:
    - Data files - Stores actual record. It can be implemented
        - Index organized tables - Stores records in index itself. 
        - heap organized tables - No particular order for record insert. Most of the time records are placed in write order.
        - hash organized tables - records are stored in buckets and the hask value of the key determines which bucket record belongs to.

    - Index files- They are organized as specialized structure that map keys to locations in data files where the records identified by these keys or primary keys.

6. Storage structures have three common variables :
    - Buffering
    - Mutability (or Immutablity)
    - Order
